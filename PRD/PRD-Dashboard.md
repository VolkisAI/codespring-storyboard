## Feature: Dashboard

### Overview
The Dashboard serves as the landing page for users, displaying all their notes in a grid or list format. It enables quick access to existing notes and provides a clear call-to-action for creating new notes. The intelligently designed UI enhances the overall user experience by allowing for smooth navigation and intuitive interactions.

### User Stories & Requirements
- As a logged-in user, I want to see a list of all my notes so that I can quickly access any note I need.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - User is authenticated via Clerk.dev.
    - Notes are displayed in either a grid or list format.
    - Each note includes a title, creation date, and a snippet of the content.
  
- As a user, I want to click on a note to navigate to the note detail page so that I can view or edit it.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Clicking a note navigates the user to the corresponding note detail page.
    - The URL correctly reflects the selected note’s unique identifier.

- As a user, I want to see loading indicators when my notes are being fetched so that I know the application is working.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - A loader is displayed while fetching notes.
    - An error message is shown if the fetch fails.

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
Provide the Drizzle ORM schema for the notes table:

```typescript
// /db/schema/notes-schema.ts
import { pgTable, uuid, varchar, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const notesTable = pgTable('notes', {
  id: uuid('id').primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  userId: uuid('user_id').notNull(),
  title: varchar('title', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  content: varchar('content').notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
});
```

#### API Endpoints / Server Actions
Implement the server action for fetching notes:

```typescript
// /actions/dashboard-actions.ts
import { db } from '../db';
import { notesTable } from '../schema/notes-schema';
import { createServerAction } from 'next/app';

export const getNotes = createServerAction(async (userId: string) => {
  return await db
    .select()
    .from(notesTable)
    .where(notesTable.userId.eq(userId))
    .execute();
});
```

#### Components Structure
Describe the component hierarchy and key components:

```
/components/dashboard/
├── dashboard.tsx
├── note-card.tsx
└── loading-spinner.tsx
```

#### State Management
State will be managed using React state in the Dashboard component. Upon component mount, the `getNotes` server action will be called to fetch the notes, and the resulting data will be stored in local state to manage rendering.

### Dependencies & Integrations
- **Clerk.dev:** For user authentication context.
- **Supabase:** For data fetching using the `getNotes` server action.
- **View & Edit Note Feature:** Implements navigation when a note is clicked.
- Required npm packages:
  - `@clerk/clerk-react` for authentication.
  - `drizzle-orm` for ORM interactions.

### Implementation Steps
1. Create the database schema for the notes table.
2. Implement the `getNotes` server action using Drizzle ORM and Supabase.
3. Configure Next.js App Router for the `/dashboard` route.
4. Design the UI using ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS.
5. Build the Dashboard component with loading and error handling.
6. Write unit tests for the `getNotes` server action and UI components.
7. Connect the frontend to the backend and ensure correct routing.

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- If the database fetch fails, display an error message instead of the notes.
- Handle cases where a user has no notes to display, showing a prompt to create a new note.
- Ensure proper loading state appears during data fetching.

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test the `getNotes` server action to ensure it fetches data correctly.
  - Test UI components for rendering based on state.
  
- **Integration Test Scenarios:**
  - Simulate user log-in and verify that the dashboard displays notes correctly.
  - Test error scenarios when the fetch fails.

- **User Acceptance Test Cases:**
  - Verify that users can log in and see their notes.
  - Ensure users can navigate to a note's detail page from the dashboard.
  - Confirm that loading and error messages appear under appropriate conditions.
